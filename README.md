Part2: Link to the Data Source: https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation

The data I have selected is concerned with answering the main drivers of deforestation. Their research concluded that the main cause of tropical deforestation is agriculture (60%), and Brazil and Indonesia are responsible for almost half of the tropical deforestation.
I selected this data because I was interested in reading its content, and it included visualizations I could recreate.


This included horizontal bar graphs with labels in descending order.

Here are my three recreations of the graph above:


Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hamze.haashi/viz/HamzeHaashiProject5/Sheet1#1 

With Tableau, I was able to order and label the graph as they have on the website, except that I could not include the percentages label (%).
Excel:

Same with Excel, I couldn't add the % on the x-axis label, and the data labels.
Python:

With python, adding data labels and % was very complicated.

Working with these three types of data visualizers, I would say that Python and excel were the easiest to work with because I had some experience with them. However, I was interested in Tableau, and I would say it is the best for analysis among the three and the best for communication. Tableau also comes with a variety of visualization models, such as area charts and maps. 

Part3: 
I have requested my personal data from Spotify and Google (Youtube Subscriptions). I have already received my google data and a confirmation email. But I am waiting to hear back from Spotify.
